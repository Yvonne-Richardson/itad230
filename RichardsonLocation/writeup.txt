As usual, I feel that I put more time into platform support than I did on programming.  I expect that to change after I build one or two stable test platforms.

I loaded Android Studio on a flash drive for portability between platforms.  I included several SDK images.  I found some usb drivers that worked with my computer and an external device. I also deleted (too many) temp files from the computer to make space on the hard drive. This made compiles take longer than usual while Android determined what caches to rebuild.

At first I put all the code in one activity, although I knew the program would be calling it from elsewhere, because did not know where the File, New Services option was.  Apparently it disappears while Android is updating its indices. I was able to compile the program successfully.

After I located the Android studio option, I put the service code into the file that should contain everything for the service. I arranged the objects on the screen in a reasonable order andremoved the file handling code. I changed all the compile options to be compatible with the device, which is SDK 19. I also turned on its location services.

I can run a program more often with an external device; the emulators either didn't load or were very slow. One or two runs per hour is insufficient for thorough testing.

At this point in time, I am still debugging; in the meantime, I am uploading the assignment before the deadline.
